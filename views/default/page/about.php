<strong>Envaya is dedicated to creating software to empower community-based organizations around the world 
that are focused on the environment, poverty relief, health, education, and community well-being.</strong>
</p>
<p>
In March, 2010, Envaya started its pilot in Tanzania, in a partnership with Journalists Environment and HIV/AIDS Network (JEAN-media), 
a Tanzanian civil society organization whose mission is to use media to promote and raise public awareness for CBOs.

<p>
The Envaya website is developed by a small team of software engineers and international development volunteers
from the United States and Canada. We believe people everywhere should have the tools they need to achieve their 
own goals.
