This module is responsible for functionality that is very specific to envaya.org 
and that is not likely to be as reusable as the 'core' code.

It includes:
* the content on the main envaya.org homepage, including featured organizations/photos    
* the TCI donation form
* Theme designs used on envaya.org
* top bar navigation / branding
* todo items for organizations
* organization qualification/registration process
