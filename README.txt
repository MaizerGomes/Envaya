Envaya is a social networking platform where the "profiles" are miniature
websites. It is partly a simple, generic, multi-user content management system
and blogging platform, and partly a structured network with tools/applications
specific to its class of users (civil society organizations in developing
countries).

Envaya is designed to be easy-to-use by people with very limited computer
skills, so it generally favors simplicity over the
flexibility/customizability/power offered by generic content management tools
such as Wordpress, Drupal, or Google Sites. Envaya also is designed for low-
bandwidth and mobile environments, and provides multilingual support including
content translation.

Potential ways of using Envaya's source code may include:

* Contributing code to be used on http://envaya.org, such as new website designs, or applications specific to civil society organizations.
* Adapting Envaya for a different class of users and hosting a service yourself. Currently this would require forking the codebase to remove the civil-society specific parts and customize the tools for another class of users.
* Studying the source code for inspiration, or adapting parts of the source code into unrelated projects.
* ...?

Envaya's source code was originally based on Elgg, a generic open-source social
networking platform, but most of Elgg's source code is now largely
unrecognizable. Some of Envaya's current code structure (URL routing,
controllers, and auto-loading) was inspired by the Kohana web framework,
although Envaya includes very little of the Kohana web framework itself.

Source Code Overview
====================
index.php 
    - Main entry point for most web requests (except for static files)
_css/
    - compressed CSS files served directly by web server, as well as entry point for testing CSS
_graphics/
    - Image files, served directly by web server
_media/
    - Other static files, such as JavaScript and Flash
config/
    - Configuration settings. Local settings should be defined in config/local.php
engine/
    - Core PHP code, mostly autoloaded classes. engine/start.php bootstraps the rest
languages/
    - Translation strings for each supported language
mod/
    - Modules (which may be stored in a separate source control repository with different licensing terms)
      Each module is a (mostly) self-contained implementation of some feature set
      Each module's directory structure looks like:
        mod/<modulename>/{_graphics,engine,languages,schema,testcases,views,start.php}      
      mod/<modulename>/start.php is called by engine/start.php to initialize the module.
schema/
    - SQL for initializing the database
scripts/
    - Miscellaneous command line scripts
test/
    - Test scripts. test/TestSuite.php is main script
vendors/
    - Third-party PHP libraries and external programs 
views/
    - PHP files loaded by view() function to render parts of the output.
      Organized by viewtype, 'default' is standard HTML view
