INSTALL

The recommended way of installing Envaya is to use the setup scripts for Ubuntu
10.04, which will install all required dependencies assuming that you are
starting from a base OS installation.

# step 0: copy source code into a world-readable directory, e.g. /var/www/envaya

# step 1: install prerequisites (mysql, nginx, php, php extensions, etc.)
# warning: the mysql root password will be reset to the empty string (should fix this...)
./scripts/server_pre_setup.sh

# step 2: create your local settings file
php scripts/install_settings.php

# optionally, edit engine/settings.php to provide desired database settings

# step 3: create empty database and default user
php scripts/db_setup.php | mysql

# step 4: install database tables and initial data
php scripts/install.php

# step 5: install system services and configuration files
# warning: should not be used on computers that already are using 
# php, fastcgi, kestrel, stunnel, or nginx for other uses. 
# Existing settings files will be overwritten.

./scripts/server_setup.sh

# step 6: create initial users 
# (required for selenium tests, but should not be used in production)    
# creates admin username:testadmin pw:testtest
# creates organization username:testorg pw:testtest
# creates organization username:envaya pw:testtest
php scripts/install_test_data.php

# optional: create admin users with custom username/password
php scripts/create_admin.php

===================
Manual Installation
-------------------

Envaya can also be set up on Windows or Mac, although there are currently no
scripts for installing the prerequisites / services / configuration files
(replacing step 1 and step 5 above).

For development environments, "php runserver.php" can be used instead of
installing kestrel, queueRunner, and phpCron as system services.

To use Apache (with mod_php) as the web server, set DocumentRoot to the root
directory where envaya's source code is located.

Envaya requires the following prerequisites:

PHP 5.3 or higher
PHP extensions:
    curl
    gd
    json
    mbstring
    mcrypt
    memcache
    PDO
    pdo_mysql
Apache or Nginx
mod_php or FastCGI
Mysql

==============================
Deploying releases to a server
------------------------------

This requires Ruby / Capistrano to be installed on your local computer.

# initial installation of all prerequisites and latest code on a server 
# (assumes ubuntu 10.04)
cap HOSTS=hostname deploy:full_setup

# subsequently, updating server to latest code
cap HOSTS=hostname deploy

=============
Running tests
-------------
Envaya's user-interface tests are in the test/ directory. 
The tests assume that a web server is running on http://localhost with 
the Envaya code being tested, that no other Envaya services are running,
and that Firefox is installed on the local computer.

cd test
